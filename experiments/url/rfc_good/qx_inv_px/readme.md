## Key to non key ration?


F >= n / u

We have 
345k non keys 



We need to make 3 experiments to figure out the key-to-non-key ration for all experiments with URL data set


1. Non keys = 345k, keys = 104k (not regarding the equation)
2. Non keys = 345k, keys <= 3.45k  (we target a F to be 0.01)
2. Non keys = 345k, keys <= 0.345k  (we target a F to be 0.001)


After these have been run with a good RFC model, we pick the most appropriate to use on the rest.



----
Takeaway:

1. We can write about how the key distrubtion affects things from this experiment 

2. We choose to
