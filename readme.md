# Benchmarking Learned Bloom Filters 
## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

### Motivation
This project has been created as part of a Bachelor project at IT-University of Copenhagen in Spring 2023. It aims to provide an open and transparent way to benchmark various Learned Bloom Filters. This project contains implementation of the following Bloom Filters in `/bloom_filters`: 
- [Regular Bloom Filter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwia6bOw9vb-AhULRvEDHfeEDLQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1145%2F362686.362692&usg=AOvVaw1ki8O_wp0JyqNAObHMFWn1) 
- [Partitioned Learned Bloom Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03176)
- [Adaptive Learned Bloom Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09131)
- [Daisy Bloom Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14894)

### Data sets 
Two different data sets are provided. 

#### URL data set 
A data set containing labeled 450,176 URLs. 345,738 beneign and 104,438 malicous. The data set is provided in `/data/raw/url_data`. [Source of data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/siddharthkumar25/detect-malicious-url-using-ml).

To vectorize the URL data run: 

```
make vectorize
```

#### Synthetic Zipfean data set 
A synthetic Zipfean data set is provided. This can be regenerated:

```
make zipf
```

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:BSc-learned-indexes/daisy-bf.git
cd daisy
```

### 2. Recommended: Creating a virtual environment 
We recommend that you install this project's dependencies in an isolated enviroment. If you are unfamiliar with this concept you can read more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
#### Create the environment 
```
python venv -m ~/.virtualenvs/daisy
```

#### Source the environment 
```
source ~/.virtualenvs/daisy/bin/activate
```

### 3. Installing dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
